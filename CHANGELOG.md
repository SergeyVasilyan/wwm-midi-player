# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Falling-note piano visualizer**: an 88-key keyboard with notes falling toward it in sync
  with playback, colored per instrument track rather than MIDI channel.
- **Per-track mute & solo**: a Tracks panel lists every instrument in the loaded file with a
  color swatch, mute toggle, and solo button, live in both Audio and WWM mode.
- **Seek**: click or drag anywhere on the progress bar to jump to that point in the track.
- **Settings persistence**: volume, Audio/WWM mode, and your playlist/selection are restored
  the next time you launch the app.
- **Auto-forward, shuffle, and repeat** playback for the playlist.
- Toast-style error/status notifications (e.g. when WWM mode can't find the game window).
- A custom frameless window with its own title bar (minimize/maximize/close) and an animated,
  click/drag-seekable progress bar.
- `README.md` screenshots, plus rewritten `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Changed

- Bundled SoundFont switched to `TOH.sf2` (Timbres of Heaven), tracked via Git LFS.
- Volume control now acts as a master multiplier over each track's own MIDI volume (CC7)
  instead of overriding it outright, so a track's own mix balance is preserved.
- Synth headroom/voice limits tuned (`gain`, `max_voices`) to avoid clipping and voice-stealing
  dropouts on dense or tempo-heavy files.
- Full UI restyle: shuffle/repeat buttons, key remapping dialog, and settings dialog all
  reworked to match the app's dark theme.
- Local development setup now uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead of plain
  `pip`/`venv`.

### Fixed

- App freezing during playback.
- Notes losing sync/dropping during playback of dense files.
- Notes being shifted to the wrong octave.
- Error toast notifications sometimes staying visible on screen after being dismissed.
- Installer's post-install "Launch app" step failing with *"CreateProcess failed; code 740"*
  on the app's elevation-required executable.
